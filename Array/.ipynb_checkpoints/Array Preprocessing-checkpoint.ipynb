    "<font color='red'>zip的用法：  </font>\n",
    "1. Let's A = [[1, 2, 3], [10, 20, 30]]\n",
    "2. zip is a Python built-in function which accepts one or more iterables (each could be a list, tuple, set, ... or any combination of them). What zip does comes below.\n",
    "3. *A inside zip represents the parameter A as two parameters [1, 2, 3] and [10, 20, 30]. Note that this is the general behaviour of * and it's called unpacking as it unpacks the iterable (A in our example) to its immediate children and makes them available for the current operation (zip in our example)\n",
    "4. Now let's see what zip does in our example: It gets [1, 2, 3] and [10, 20, 30] and returns (1, 10), (2, 20), (3, 30) [Please see note 5]. As you see, it gathers all the first elements (of the children) together and creates a tuple out of them. And then gathers the second elements and creates the second tuple. The same idea applies in general case. As you see this is basically the definition of transpose.\n",
    "5. Important Note: zip (in Python 3) actually does not return the entire result set in one shot. What it actually does is doing it lazily, meaning it returns an iterator which the user can ask to generate step by step (as in for or while loop or assigning it to a variable for a later use). However, you can wrap a function around it to force it to return the whole result in one shot (as in list(zip(...) function, ....).\n",
    "6. Among many things Python 3 behaves differently than Python 2, zip is one of the famous examples:\n",
    "    - Returning lazily: zip in Python 3 equals (behaves as) Izip in Python 2\n",
    "    - Always returning the entire result as a list in one shot: for how zip behaves in Python 2 there is no equivalent built-in function in Python 3. This means zip(..) in python 2 equals list(zip(...) in Python 3"
